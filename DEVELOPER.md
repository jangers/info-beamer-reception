# Developer information

This package also serves as a template on how
custom user interfaces can be built.

The `config.html` page is used instead of the
autogenerated interface defined in `node.json`.

It can communicate with the info-beamer hosted
page using the `ib.*` API. See the bottom of
[config.js](config.json) for that.

The node.lua code can also be used as a
template to build other content. Have a look
at the `playlist` function in [node.lua](node.lua)
for that. It basically generates a set of Tiles
that are displayed in the next iteration of the
playlist. You can freely mix and adapt the
available tiles (`Image`, `Video`, `Markup`, `Flat`)
or plug in your own tile using the `TileChild`
example. Have a look at [scroller/tile.lua](tile.lua in scroller)
to see how the API works.
